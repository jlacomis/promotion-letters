  I am writing in support of the promotion of Claire Le~Goues to the position of
  Associate Professor. Claire is currently my Ph.D. co-advisor, and she is
  largely responsible for my success as a student.

  I have known Claire for nine years, since she was a graduate student at the
  University of Virginia. I met her through a mutual friend who was a member of
  the same research group as her. Although I wasn't close friends with Claire, I
  found her research on GenProg to be particularly fascinating. Her work on
  GenProg is one of the major factors directly responsible for my initial
  interest in computer science and my decision to return to school.

  I can confidently say that I would not be a student at Carnegie Mellon
  University if it were not for Claire. Near the end of my undergraduate
  education at the University of Virginia I was a researcher in Claire's former
  group. As my graduate school application deadline was approaching, Claire
  visited the group office at UVa to meet with colleagues. When she saw me she
  bluntly asked me if I was applying to CMU. At the time I was convinced that
  applying would have been a waste of time and money because of my
  self-perceived weak academic history and fear of the strong competition at top
  schools. Claire informed me that I was wrong and insisted that I apply,
  encouraging me to email her directly if I had any questions or needed any
  help. If she had not taken the time to initiate this conversation I would not
  be where I am today.

  I took 17-355, Program Analysis with Claire and Jonathan Aldrich and really
  enjoy Claire's teaching style. She genuinely loves her field and teaches with
  great enthusiasm. The discussions in class were engaging, and the assignments
  were interesting and helped with my understanding of the course
  material. My interactions with her in the classroom and observations of her
  interaction with REU students convince me that she cares deeply about
  pedagogy.

  Claire has been an extremely effective co-advisor. Despite the large size of
  her research group, she still is able to find the time to interact with her
  students one-on-one whenever they need guidance. She is skilled at finding the
  right balance between pushing me to my full potential and helping me to set
  realistic goals. With her guidance I have exceeded my own expectations for my
  first year of graduate school.

  Finally, Claire is fun and enjoyable to spend time with. I am always glad when
  she is able to show up to informal meetings or social events and never dread
  running into her. Graduate school can be a stressful, high-pressure
  environment and I am glad to have a co-advisor who is cognizant of this fact
  and careful not to add to the stress. For these reasons, I strongly support
  Claire's promotion and look forward to finishing my Ph.D. under her guidance.
