  I am writing in support of the reappointment of Bogdan Vasilescu to the
  position of Assistant Professor. Bogdan is currently my Ph.D. co-advisor, and
  his advice and guidance have been essential to my success.

  I have known Bogdan for a year and a half. I first met him during my CMU visit
  day after my admission as a Ph.D. student. In our one-on-one meeting, he
  briefly introduced me to his research, and we began formulating new research
  questions for future work almost immediately. I left the meeting full of ideas
  and with a list of interesting papers to read. This brief interaction was so
  productive that I immediately began considering him as an advisor.

  Bogdan has continued to be a constant source of ideas and inspiration as my
  co-advisor. As soon as I arrived at CMU I was able to start work on a project
  that we had discussed during my visit day, which led to my first publication
  as a Ph.D. student. This trend has continued: he has a deep knowledge of
  current literature, and is always suggesting new research directions or ideas
  for expanding my current research. In addition to being full of ideas, he is
  also willing to let me explore my own. He does not insist that I follow his
  research agenda, and I am comfortable telling Bogdan exactly how I feel about
  research that I find uninteresting. As a student, I enjoy this openness and
  the ability to speak candidly with my co-advisor.

  Although I have not taken a full class with Bogdan, I did find his lessons in
  the immigration course quite interesting. His exercises were illustrative and
  helped demonstrate state-of-the-art data analysis tools and techniques. He is
  always the first person I go to with questions about statistical methods or
  data processing. He has taken time to sit down with me in my office and help
  with learning tools that I was unfamiliar with. He is a patient and receptive
  teacher and I find learning from him to be a pleasure.

  Bogdan is also enjoyable to be around and is a kind and generous person. He
  makes sure to ask about my well-being and advises me to take breaks or days
  off if I need them. As a graduate student I have found that maintaining an
  appropriate level of stress just as important as academic performance, and it
  is helpful to have a co-advisor who is aware of this and actively makes sure
  that I am taking care of myself. I strongly support Bogdan's reappointment: I
  genuinely enjoy having him as a co-advisor and look forward to finishing a
  Ph.D. with his guidance.
